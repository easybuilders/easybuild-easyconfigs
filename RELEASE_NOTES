v1.1.0 (January 27th 2013)
--------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- added 3 new generic easyblocks: CMakePythonPackage, JAR, RPackage
- added support for 23 new software packages that require customized support:
    - ACML, ALADIN, ant, Bioconductor (R packages), Chapel, Cufflinks, ESPResSo, FLUENT, Geant4, GHC, Java, NEURON,
      NWChem, PyZMQ, QuantumESPRESSO, R, Rmpi, ROOT, Rserve, SCOOP, Trinity, VSC-tools, XML
- various enhancements, including:
    - clean up of python.py module:
        - merge EB_DefaultPythonPackage and PythonPackage easyblocks into generic easyblock PythonPackage, which derives from ExtensionEasyblock
        - move EB_FortranPythonPackage into dedicated generic FortranPythonPackage easyblock module
        - split off support for building/installing nose, numpy, scipy into dedicated EB_* easyblock modules,
          which allows them to be built as stand-alone modules as well
    - clean up testing of Python packages (PythonPackage easyblock)
    - make sure there is no site.cfg in home dir when building Python packages, because e.g. scipy will pick it up
    - added support for building Intel MKL wrappers with OpenMPI toolchain
    - cleaning up of fake module that was loaded for running tests
    - move calls to functions that rely on environment up in the chain of steps (mostly for cleanup reasons)
    - use better module name for UFC sanity check, minor change to sanity check paths for UFC
- various bug fixes, including:
    - only call 'make ptcheck' for ATLAS when multi-threading support is enabled
    - use a symbolic link for $HOME/intel instead of a randomly suffixed subdirectory in home + patching of Intel install scripts
        - latter does not work anymore with recent versions of Intel tools (2013.x)

v1.0.2 (December 8th 2012)
--------------------------

---------------------------

bugfix release

- fix GCC build on OS X
    - location of libraries is slightly different (lib vs lib64 dir)
- add support to ConfigureMake easyblock for pre-passing tar options to configure
    - see tar_config_opts easyconfig parameter
    - workaround for issue with pax hanging configure with an interactive prompt
- enhance Q&A for WRF and WIEN2k by adding entries to qa dict and no_qa list
- use rmtree2 from tools/filetools.py as more (NFS) robust replacement for shutil.rmtree

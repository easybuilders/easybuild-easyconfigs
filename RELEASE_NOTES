      UDUNITS (#167), VTune (#232), YamCha (#131)

    - the newly added toolchains only differ in compilers/MPI library, and all feature OpenBLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK and FFTW
    - goolfc: GCC, CUDA (co-compiler), OpenMPI (#191)
        - a goolfc easyconfig for GROMACS is inluded as proof-of-concept (#165)
    - cgmpolf: Clang (C/C++ compilers), GCC (Fortran compilers), MPICH (#213)
    - cgmvolf: Clang, GCC, MVAPICH2 (#218)
    - cgoolf: Clang, GCC, OpenMPI (#213)

v1.3.0.0 (April 1st 2013)
-------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- added example easyconfig files for 13 new software packages:
    - Bash, CUDA, ccache, Ferret, gzip, libxc, ns, numactl, OpenBLAS, otcl, Tar, tclcl, tcsh
        - several of these easyconfig files were contributed by attendees of the EasyBuild hackathon in Cyprus!
- added example easyconfigs for goolf toolchain (#158)
- added example easyconfigs for builds with goolf toolchain, i.e. for all goalf easyconfigs (#189)
    - for several software packages, a patch file was needed to get them to build with GCC 4.7:
        AMOS, BEAGLE, Cufflinks, DOLFIN, GATE, ns, Pasha, Trilinos, Trinity
    - for PETSc, a patch file was required to make it build with a toolchain that doesn't include BLACS
- added additional example easyconfig files for:
    gompi, hwloc, LAPACK, MVAPICH2, OpenMPI, ScaLAPACK
- various enhancements, including:
    - define a proper module class in *all* easyconfigs, cfr. default module classes defined in framework (#150, #159, #161, #162, #179, #181)
    - extend FFTW easyconfig to 'fat' builds that include single, double, long double and quad precision libraries in the same module
        - quad precision is disabled for Intel compiler based builds (it requires GCC v4.6+)
    - the imkl easyconfigs used for the ictce 3.2.2.u3 toolchain now also enable FFTW interfaces
- various 'bug' fixes, including:
    - fix filename for Mercurial and ROOT easyconfig files
    - fix homepage/description for Hypre
    - fix enabling OpenMP support in OpenMPI: use '--enable-openmp', not 'with-openmp'
    - use correct configure flag for enabling OpenMPI threading support in v1.6 (#186)
        - '--enable-mpi-thread-multiple' instead of '--enable-mpi-threads'
    - explicitely add '--without-openib --without-udapl' configure options in OpenMPI easyconfig using versionsuffix -no-OFED (#168)
        - this avoids that OpenMPI auto-detects that it can enable Infiniband (OpenIB) support, which doesn't fit the -no-OFED versionsuffix
        - Note: this makes goalf-1.1.0-no-OFED effectively not suitable to produce software builds that are IB-capable!
    - remove explicit '--with-udapl' from OpenMPI easyconfigs, does more harm than good (#178)
    - remove libibvers, libibmad, libibumad as explicit dependencies for OpenMPI/MVAPICH2 (#173, #182)
        leave it up to the OS to provide these, since the required version is too much tied to the version of IB drivers
    - use 'license_file' in Intel tools easyconfigs, as opposed to the new generic 'license' parameter with a different meaning (#180)
    - modify patch for impi to avoid installation problems due to hardcoded path in /tmp (#185)
        - now uses '$USER-$RANDOM' subdir to avoid clashes between different users on the same system
    - the patch file for numpy was extended to also supporting ATLAS and other BLAS libraries spread across multiple directories
        - the extension for ATLAS is required because we now no longer rely on the automatic numpy mechanism to find the ATLAS libs
    - fixed dependencies:
        - libibumad as dependency for libibmad
        - ncurses as dependency for libreadline
        - ncurses and zlib as dependency for SAMtools (+ enhanced patch)
        - remove explicit FFTW dependency for Meep, ... since toolchain already provided FFTW

- various enhancements, including:
    - major style cleanup of all example easyconfig file (PEP008 compliance)
    - added setuptools to list of Python extensions

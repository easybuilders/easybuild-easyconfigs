- packaged EasyBuild, different parts can now be installed easily using easy_install
- added example easyconfig files for 106 new software packages:
    AMOS, Armadillo, ASE, Autoconf, BiSearch, Boost, Bowtie2, BWA, byacc, bzip2, CGAL, ClustalW2, CMake,
    CPLEX, cURL, CVXOPT, Cython, Docutils, DOLFIN, ECore, Eigen, expat, FASTX-Toolkit, FFC, FIAT,
    freetype, FSL, GEOS, git, glproto, GMP, gmvapich2, gompi, GPAW, GSL, guile, h5py, h5utils, Harminv,
    hwloc, Hypre, Infernal, Instant, Jinja2, libctl, libdrm, libffi, libgtextutils, libmatheval,
    libpciaccess, libpthread-stubs, libreadline, libtool, libunistring, libxcb, libxml2, makedepend,
    matplotlib, Meep, Mercurial, Mesa, MetaVelvet, METIS, MPFR, MTL4, MUMmer, ncurses, OpenFOAM, OpenSSL,
    ORCA, PAPI, ParMETIS, Pasha, PCRE, PETSc, petsc4py, pkg-config, Primer3, python-meep, RNAz, SAMtools,
    ScientificPython, SCOTCH, setuptools, Shapely, SHRiMP, SLEPc, SOAPdenovo, Sphinx, SuiteSparse, SWIG,
    Tcl, Theano, Tk, Tornado, Trilinos, UFC, UFL, Velvet, ViennaRNA, Viper, WIEN2k, xcb-proto, XCrySDen,
    xorg-macros, xproto
- added additional example easyconfig files (versions, builds) for several software packages
    Bison, BLACS, Doxygen, flex, GCC, HDF5, icc, ifort, libpng, M4, MVAPICH2, OpenMPI, Szip, tbb, zlib
- replaced GCC/OpenMPI based easyconfig files with equivalents using the gompi toolchain
    ATLAS, BLACS, FFTW, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK
- enhanced Python example easyconfig files (more dependencies required for features, e.g. libreadline, bzip2, zlib, ...)
- corrected file name of easyconfig files to adher to standard as followed by EasyBuild robot dependency resolver
- style cleanup in existing easyconfig files

v0.8 (June 29th 2012)
---------------------

- added support for building/installing 17 additional software packages:
    - BEAGLE, Doxygen, g2clib, g2lib, HDF, HDF5, JasPer, libpng, Maple, 
      MrBayes, NCL, netCDF, netCDF-Fortran, Szip, WPS, WRF, zlib
- the build procedure for WRF and WPS includes running the tests available for these packages
- various bug fixes and enhancements:
    - made support for interactive installers (run_cmd_qa) more robust
    - fixed Python git package check
    - implemented toolkit functions for determine compiler family, MPI type, MPI run command, ...

v0.7 (June 18th 2012)
---------------------

- fixed BLACS build
    - diagnostic tools to determine INTERFACE and TRANSCOMM values are now used
- added support for building Bison, CP2K, flex
    - with regression test enabled for CP2K as part of build process
    - note: BLACS built with EasyBuild prior to v0.7 needs to be rebuilt for CP2K to work correctly
- added --enable-mpi-threads to OpenMPI example easyconfigs
    - required for correct CP2K psmp build
- adjusted libsmm example easyconfig for lower build time
    - to make the full regression test finish in a reasonable amount of time
- added script to make porting of easyblocks from old to new EasyBuild codebase easier
    - takes care of refactoring, checks for PyLint warnings/errors, ...
- fixed several small bugs
- prefixed EasyBuild messages with "=="
- full regression test passed (58 easyconfigs tested)

v0.6 (May 11th 2012)
---------------------

- added support for Intel compiler toolkit (ictce)
    - which included the Intel compilers, Intel Math Kernel Library (imkl) and Intel MPI library (impi)
- added support for building Python with nose/numpy/scipy packages
- added simple regression test
- this version is able to build all supplied example easyconfigs

v0.5 (April 6th 2012)
----------------------

- first public release of EasyBuild
    - after a thorough cleanup of the EasyBuild framework of the in-house version
- supports building HPL with goalf compiler toolkit
    - the goalf toolkit consists of the GCC compilers, and the OpenMPI, ATLAS, LAPACK, FFTW and ScaLAPACK libraries
- also support build and installation of MVAPICH2

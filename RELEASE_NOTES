This file contains a description of the major changes to the easybuild-easyblocks EasyBuild package.
For more detailed information, please see the git log.

The latest version of easybuild-easyblocks provides 100 software-specific easyblocks and 14 generic easyblocks.

v1.4.0 (TBA)
------------

- API changes:
    - CMakeMake.configure_step() parameter 'builddir' was renamed to 'srcdir', because the name 'builddir' is
      incorrect.  This parameter specifies the path to the directory containing source files.

v1.3.0 (April 1st 2013)
-----------------------

feature + bugfix release
- added support for 2 new software packages that require customized support:
    - CUDA, (#145) Ferret (#160, #163)
- remove 'license' easyconfig parameter from IntelBase, since it clashes with generic 'license' parameter (#153, #158)
    - 'license_file' should be used instead (see https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework/pull/569/files)
    - using 'license' instead of 'license_file' will be supported until v2.x for legacy purposes
- various enhancements, including:
    - stop hardcoding Python site-packages library dir, obtain it via distutils.sysconfig instead (#141, #156, #159, #161)
    - stop hardcoding list of libraries for BLAS libs, ask toolchain modules or use LIBBLAS instead (#150, #155)
    - enhanced CP2K easyblock, following Intel guidelines for ictce builds (#138)
    - added setup.cfg for setup.py to allow creating RPMs (#140)
    - clean up specifying BLAS/LAPACK libs for building numpy, check whether requires patch is being used for IMKL builds (refs #155, #161)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - added zip_safe flag to setup.py, to silence multitude of warnings (#135)
    - install EasyBuild packages in reversed order to avoid funky setuptools issues (#139)
    - fixed a typo in the ScaLAPACK easyblock, and set CCFLAGS and FCFLAGS for v2.x (#149, #162)
    - fix sanity check for python-meep (#159)
    - exclude Python tests from DOLFIN sanity check, since they hang sometimes (#161)
    - add support in ALADIN easyblock for answering question on location of libgrib_api.a (#165)

v1.2.0 (February 28th 2013)
---------------------------

feature + bugfix release

    - EasyBuild, EPD (Enthought Python Distribution), freetype, MATLAB, QLogic MPI (RPM), TotalView
    - support for installing EasyBuild with EasyBuild enables bootstrapping an EasyBuild installation!
- various enhancements, including:
    - corrections in WRF/WPS to also enable building with iqacml toolchain
        - use mpi_cmd_for instead of hardcoding test commands, using correct Fortran compilers (F90)
    - fix NCL easyblock to also support v6.1.x
        - use correct Fortran compiler (F90), set correct lib/include paths for dependencies (netCDF-Fortran, GDAL)
    - cleanup sweep of license headers and authors list in easyblock module docstrings
    - use new 'ext_name' template name in 'exts_filter' in Python and R easyblocks
- various bug fixes, including:
    - general code cleanup
        - don't set sanityCheckOK in Toolchain easyblock
        - get rid of using os.putenv
    - NEURON easyblock: don't hardcode number of processes used in test cases
    - make sure easybuild.easyblocks.generic namespace is extendable

v1.1.0 (January 27th 2013)
--------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- added 3 new generic easyblocks: CMakePythonPackage, JAR, RPackage
- added support for 23 new software packages that require customized support:
    - ACML, ALADIN, ant, Bioconductor (R packages), Chapel, Cufflinks, ESPResSo, FLUENT, Geant4, GHC, Java, NEURON,
      NWChem, PyZMQ, QuantumESPRESSO, R, Rmpi, ROOT, Rserve, SCOOP, Trinity, VSC-tools, XML
- various enhancements, including:
    - clean up of python.py module:
        - merge EB_DefaultPythonPackage and PythonPackage easyblocks into generic easyblock PythonPackage, which derives from ExtensionEasyblock
        - move EB_FortranPythonPackage into dedicated generic FortranPythonPackage easyblock module
        - split off support for building/installing nose, numpy, scipy into dedicated EB_* easyblock modules,
          which allows them to be built as stand-alone modules as well
    - clean up testing of Python packages (PythonPackage easyblock)
    - make sure there is no site.cfg in home dir when building Python packages, because e.g. scipy will pick it up
    - added support for building Intel MKL wrappers with OpenMPI toolchain
    - cleaning up of fake module that was loaded for running tests
    - move calls to functions that rely on environment up in the chain of steps (mostly for cleanup reasons)
    - use better module name for UFC sanity check, minor change to sanity check paths for UFC
- various bug fixes, including:
    - only call 'make ptcheck' for ATLAS when multi-threading support is enabled
    - use a symbolic link for $HOME/intel instead of a randomly suffixed subdirectory in home + patching of Intel install scripts
        - latter does not work anymore with recent versions of Intel tools (2013.x)

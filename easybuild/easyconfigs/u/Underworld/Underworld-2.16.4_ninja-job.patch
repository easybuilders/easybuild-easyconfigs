Without that patch, Ninja is taken over the node and uses every available core
The patch is using the UNDERWORLD_BUILD_PARALLEL variable, so set, else it is falling back to
use 4 cores. The UNDERWORLD_BUILD_PARALLEL is either set in the EasyConfig file, or comes from 
an environment variable. The latter is what Kenneth Hoste suggested so it can be used upstream
as well

description = """
UniFrac is the de facto repository for high-performance phylogenetic diversity
calculations. The methods in this repository are based on an implementation of
the Strided State UniFrac algorithm which is faster, and uses less memory than
Fast UniFrac. Strided State UniFrac supports Unweighted UniFrac, Weighted
UniFrac, Generalized UniFrac, Variance Adjusted UniFrac and meta UniFrac, in
both double and single precision (fp32). This repository also includes Stacked
Faith (manuscript in preparation), a method for calculating Faith's PD that is
faster and uses less memory than the Fast UniFrac-based reference
implementation."""

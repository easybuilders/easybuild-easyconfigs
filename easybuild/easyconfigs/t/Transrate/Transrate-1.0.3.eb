 It examines your assembly in detail and compares it to experimental evidence
 such as the sequencing reads, reporting quality scores for contigs and
 assemblies. This allows you to choose between assemblers and parameters,
 filter out the bad contigs from an assembly, and help decide when
 to stop trying to improve the assembly."""

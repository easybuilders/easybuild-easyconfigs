description = """tCONCOORD predicts protein conformational flexibility based on geometrical
 considerations. In a first step, the protein structure is analyzed and turned into a set of
 constraints, mostly distance constraints but also angle, chiral and planarity constraints with
 upper and lower bounds. This set of constraints serves as a kind of construction plan for the protein.
 In a second step, the protein structure is rebuilt based on the predefined constraints. Starting
 from random atomic coordinates the constraints are fulfilled iteratively and a new structure is
 'constructed'. Repeating this procedure several times leads to an ensemble of structures which
 represents a good sampling of the conformational space. """

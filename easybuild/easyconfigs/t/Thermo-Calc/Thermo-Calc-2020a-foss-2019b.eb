# 1. Get the file titled e.g. 'Thermo-Calc-linux-2020.1.60405-124.run' from Met & Mat
#    a. Note that for TC 2020a this file was erroneously named with a .man instead of .run extension
# 2. Tar this: "tar -cvz -f Thermo-Calc-2020a.tar.gz Thermo-Calc-linux-2020.1.60405-124.run"
# 3. Copy the resulting file to the sources directory

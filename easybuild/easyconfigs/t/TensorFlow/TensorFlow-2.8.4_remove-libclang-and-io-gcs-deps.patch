This combines two patches from TensorFlow 2.7.1.

tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem is not available as a binary for all architectures and
building it requires TensorFlow to be installed, i.e. there is a cyclic dependency.
As it is not actually required (but optional) remove it from `REQUIRED_PACKAGES`.
See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/56636

libclang was introduced in
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c211472000ff57bac7fcec9b0465cf73b37bf135
> This is in preparation to open-source TF's TFRT backend.
> TFRT generates code using libclang python bindings as part of the build.
Hence it is not currently used and as it is not (easily) available for all architectures
simply remove it.

 genetic markers subjected to selection and/or associated to population-specific covariates 
 (e.g., environmental variables, quantitative or categorical phenotypic characteristics). 
 The underlying models explicitly account for (and may estimate) the covariance structure among the
 population allele frequencies that originates from the shared history of the populations under study"""

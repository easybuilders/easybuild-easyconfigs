description = """Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance with KrakEN) 
is a highly accurate statistical method that computes the abundance of 
species in DNA sequences from a metagenomics sample. Braken uses the 
taxonomy labels assigned by Kraken, a highly accurate metagenomics 
classification algorithm, to estimate the number of reads originating 
from each species present in a sample. Kraken classifies reads to the 
best matching location in the taxonomic tree, but does not estimate 
abundances of species. We use the Kraken database itself to derive 
probabilities that describe how much sequence from each genome is 
identical to other genomes in the database, and combine this information 
with the assignments for a particular sample to estimate abundance at 
the species level, the genus level, or above. Combined with the Kraken 
classifier, Bracken produces accurate species- and genus-level abundance 
estimates even when a sample contains two or more near-identical species.

NOTE: Bracken is compatible with both Kraken 1 and Kraken 2. However, the 
default kmer length is different depending on the version of Kraken used. 
If you use Kraken 1 defaults, specify 31 as the kmer length. If you use 
Kraken 2 defaults, specify 35 as the kmer length."""

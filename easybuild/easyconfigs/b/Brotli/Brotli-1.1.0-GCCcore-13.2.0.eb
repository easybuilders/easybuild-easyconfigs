 of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a compression ratio
 comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate
 but offers more dense compression.
The specification of the Brotli Compressed Data Format is defined in RFC 7932."""

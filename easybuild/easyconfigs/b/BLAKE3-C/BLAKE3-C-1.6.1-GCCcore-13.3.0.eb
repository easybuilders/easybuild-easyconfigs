description = """BLAKE3 is a cryptographic hash function that is:
Much faster than MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, and BLAKE2.
Secure, unlike MD5 and SHA-1. And secure against length extension, unlike SHA-2.
Highly parallelizable across any number of threads and SIMD lanes, because it's
a Merkle tree on the inside.
Capable of verified streaming and incremental updates, again because it's a
Merkle tree.
A PRF, MAC, KDF, and XOF, as well as a regular hash."""

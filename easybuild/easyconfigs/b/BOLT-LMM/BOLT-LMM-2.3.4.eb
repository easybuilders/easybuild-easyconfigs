description = """The BOLT-LMM algorithm computes statistics for testing association between phenotype
 and genotypes using a linear mixed model (LMM) [1]. By default, BOLT-LMM assumes a Bayesian
 mixture-of-normals prior for the random effect attributed to SNPs other than the one being tested.
 This model generalizes the standard “infinitesimal” mixed model used by previous mixed model
 association methods (e.g., EMMAX, FaST-LMM, GEMMA, GRAMMAR-Gamma, GCTA-LOCO), providing an
 opportunity for increased power to detect associations while controlling false
 positives. Additionally, BOLT-LMM applies algorithmic advances to compute mixed model association
 statistics much faster than eigendecomposition-based methods, both when using the Bayesian mixture
 model and when specialized to standard mixed model association."""

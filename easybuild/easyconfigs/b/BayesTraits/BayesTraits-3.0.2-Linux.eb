description = """ BayesTraits is a computer package for performing analyses of trait 
 evolution among groups of species for which a phylogeny or sample of phylogenies is 
 available. This new package incoporates our earlier and separate programes Multistate, 
 Discrete and Continuous. BayesTraits can be applied to the analysis of traits that adopt 
 a finite number of discrete states, or to the analysis of continuously varying traits. 
 Hypotheses can be tested about models of evolution, about ancestral states and about 
 correlations among pairs of traits. """

description = """BFAST facilitates the fast and accurate mapping of short reads to reference sequences.
 Some advantages of BFAST include:
 1) Speed: enables billions of short reads to be mapped quickly. 
 2) Accuracy: A priori probabilities for mapping reads with defined set of variants. 
 3) An easy way to measurably tune accuracy at the expense of speed."""

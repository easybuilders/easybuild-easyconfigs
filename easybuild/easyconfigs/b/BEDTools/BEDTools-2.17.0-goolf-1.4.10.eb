 computing coverage. The utilities are largely based on four widely-used file formats: BED, GFF/GTF, VCF, and SAM/BAM.
 Using BEDTools, one can develop sophisticated pipelines that answer complicated research questions by "streaming"
 several BEDTools together. The following are examples of common questions that one can address with BEDTools."""

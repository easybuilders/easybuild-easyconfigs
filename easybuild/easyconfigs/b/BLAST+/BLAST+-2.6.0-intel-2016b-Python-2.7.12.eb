# The patch contains two fixes:
# - The authors forgot to reinstall the correct root configure script (which is 
#   available as configure.orig).
# - A correction to Makefile.in.top, install-toolkit target: The last install
#   created an error message, so it has been replaced by two commands that 
#   hopefully perform the action that the authors intended.

description = """ BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences
 using MCMC. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using
 strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies
 but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single
 tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted
 proportional to its posterior probability. """

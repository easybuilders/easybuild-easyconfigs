description = """ BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular 
 sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using 
 strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies 
 but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single 
 tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted 
 proportional to its posterior probability. """

description = """ BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular 
 sequences using MCMC. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies 
 inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of 
 reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses 
 without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, 
 so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. We include a simple 
 to use user-interface program for setting up standard analyses and a suit of programs for 
 analysing the results. """

# beast script has java.library.path hardcoded to /usr/local/lib.

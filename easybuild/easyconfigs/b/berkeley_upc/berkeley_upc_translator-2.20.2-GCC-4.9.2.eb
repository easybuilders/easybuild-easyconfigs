description = """Unified Parallel C (UPC) is an extension of the C programming
language designed for high performance computing on large-scale parallel
machines.The language provides a uniform programming model for both shared and
distributed memory hardware. The programmer is presented with a single shared,
partitioned address space, where variables may be directly read and written by
any processor, but each variable is physically associated with a single
processor. UPC uses a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model of computation
in which the amount of parallelism is fixed at program startup time, typically
with a single thread of execution per processor."""

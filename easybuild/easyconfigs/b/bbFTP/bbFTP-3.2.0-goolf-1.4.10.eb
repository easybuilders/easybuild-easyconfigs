description = """bbFTP is a file transfer software. It implements its own transfer protocol,
  which is optimized for large files (larger than 2GB) and secure as it does not read the
  password in a file and encrypts the connection information. bbFTP main features are:
  * Encoded username and password at connection * SSH and Certificate authentication modules
  * Multi-stream transfer * Big windows as defined in RFC1323 * On-the-fly data compression
  * Automatic retry * Customizable time-outs * Transfer simulation
  * AFS authentication integration * RFIO interface"""

description = """
BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences
using MCMC. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using
strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies
but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single
tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted
proportional to its posterior probability.

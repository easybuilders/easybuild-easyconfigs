description = """BBCP is an alternative to Gridftp when transferring large amounts of data,
  capable of breaking up your transfer into multiple simultaneous transferring streams,
  thereby transferring data much faster than single-streaming utilities such as SCP and SFTP.
  See details at http://pcbunn.cithep.caltech.edu/bbcp/using_bbcp.htm
  or http://www.nics.tennessee.edu/computing-resources/data-transfer/bbcp"""

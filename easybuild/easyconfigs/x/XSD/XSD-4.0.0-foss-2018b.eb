 Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema), it generates C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary
 as well as XML parsing and serialization code. You can then access the data stored in XML using types and functions
 that semantically correspond to your application domain rather than dealing with the intricacies of reading and writing XML"""

 genetic variation data. The specific focus is to provide a platform for analytic tool 
 development for variation data from large-scale resequencing and genotyping projects, 
 particularly whole-exome and whole-genome studies. It is independent of (but designed 
 to be complementary to) the existing PLINK package. """

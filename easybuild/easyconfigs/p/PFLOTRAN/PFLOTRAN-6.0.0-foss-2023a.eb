PFLOTRAN is an open source, state-of-the-art massively parallel 
subsurface flow and reactive transport code. PFLOTRAN solves a 
system of generally nonlinear partial differential equations 
describing multiphase, multicomponent and multiscale reactive flow 
and transport in porous materials. The code is designed to run on 
massively parallel computing architectures as well as workstations 
and laptops.

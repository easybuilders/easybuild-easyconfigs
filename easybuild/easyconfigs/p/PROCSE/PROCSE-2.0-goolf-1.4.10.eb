description = """PROCSE (PRObabilistic Clustering of Sequences) is a Bayesian algorithm 
 for clustering sequences over a finite alphabet (designed specifically for DNA sequences) 
 into groups using a mixture model that assumes all sequences in a group derive from a common 
 position-specific weight matrix (which is automatically integrated out of the likelihood). 
 The program uses Markov chain Monte-Carlo sampling to sample the space o all partitions of 
 the input sequences into subsets. Optionally, the user can specify informative priors regarding 
 the expected numbers and sizes of clusters. The algorithm has been predominantly used to infer 
 groups of binding sites forDNA or RNA binding proteins.

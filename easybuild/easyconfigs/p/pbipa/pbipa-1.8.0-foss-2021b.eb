software for HiFi genome assembly. IPA was designed to utilize the
accuracy of PacBio HiFi reads to produce high-quality phased genome
assemblies. IPA is an end-to-end solution, starting with input reads and
resulting in a polished assembly. IPA is fast, providing an easy to use
local run mode or a distributed pipeline for a cluster."""

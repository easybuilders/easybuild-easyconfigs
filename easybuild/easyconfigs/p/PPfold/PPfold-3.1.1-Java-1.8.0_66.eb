description = """PPfold is a new implementation of pfold, written in Java 6.0. It can predict the consensus secondary
 structure of RNA alignments through a stochastic context-free grammar coupled to an evolutionary model.
 It can also use data from chemical probing experiments to predict RNA secondary structure. PPfold is multithreaded,
 and can solve the structure of much longer alignments than pfold."""

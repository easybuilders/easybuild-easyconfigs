structural and physicochemical features, which are very useful in representing and distinguishing
proteins or peptides of different structural, functional and interaction properties. These have
been widely used in developing methods and software for predicting protein structural and
functional classes, protein-protein interactions, drug-target interactions, protein substrates,
among others."""

 (factorizations, algebraic  number theory, elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other useful
 functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc.,
 and a lot of transcendental functions. PARI is  also available as a C library to allow for faster computations.

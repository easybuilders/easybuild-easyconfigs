 simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI), written in Python and
 making use of the Enthought Traits/UI packages. It is intended to give
 students, hobbyists, and curious engineers the ability to play with
 serial communication link design concepts. It is not intended as a
 mission critical tool for use by professional serial communication
 link designers. There are much better tools available for that purpose."""

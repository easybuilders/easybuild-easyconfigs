This test has ~400 sub-tests marked as xfail, i.e. expected to fail.
A comment states
> these sometimes pass and sometimes fail

That doesn't match the definition of "xfail"/"unittest.expectedFailure" as some are really
"expected failures" which have to fail (like some operators which are not defined for the type tested)

To reduce the flakiness and verbosity of this test suite (every xfailed tests prints an error and a rather large backtrace)
just skip those tests by setting the last element in each tuple of the list to `False`,
see the definition of `fail` vs `xfail` in that file.

# We've seen that these tests fail for version 1.11.0, see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/76107
# These failures probably point to underlying issues, but the PR that fixes them touches a ton of files
# It's near-impossible to cherry pick that, without causing other issues. Moreover,
# PyTorch devs have pointed out that nvfuser is not enabled by default in 1.11.0, so chances of anyone
# hitting these issues are very small
# We simply disable the tests and accept that in v 1.11.0 in PyTorch, this functionality is broken.

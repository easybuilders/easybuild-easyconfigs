 edge addition planar graph embedding algorithm and related algorithms, including a planar graph
 drawing method, an isolator for a minimal subgraph obstructing planarity in non-planar graphs,
 outerplanar graph embedder and obstruction isolator algorithms, and tester/isolator algorithms
 for subgraphs homeomorphic to K2,3, K4, and K3,3."""

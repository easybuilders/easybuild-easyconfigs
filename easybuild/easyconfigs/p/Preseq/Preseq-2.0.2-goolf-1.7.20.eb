description = """The preseq package is aimed at predicting and estimating the complexity of a genomic 
 sequencing library, equivalent to predicting and estimating the number of redundant reads from a given 
 sequencing depth and how many will be expected from additional sequencing using an initial sequencing experiment. 
 The estimates can then be used to examine the utility of further sequencing, optimize the sequencing depth, 
 or to screen multiple libraries to avoid low complexity samples"""

description = """ PhyloGibbs is an algorithm for discovering regulatory sites in a 
 collection of DNA sequences, including multiple alignments of orthologous sequences 
 from related organisms. Many existing approaches to either search for sequence-motifs 
 that are overrepresented in the input data, or for sequence-segments that are more 
 conserved evolutionary than expected. PhyloGibbs combines these two approaches and 
 identifies significant sequence-motifs by taking both over-representation and conservation 
 signals into account. """

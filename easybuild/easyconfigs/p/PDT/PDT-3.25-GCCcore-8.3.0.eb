 Program Database Toolkit (PDT) is a framework for analyzing source code
 written in several programming languages and for making rich program
 knowledge accessible to developers of static and dynamic analysis tools.
 PDT implements a standard program representation, the program database
 (PDB), that can be accessed in a uniform way through a class library
 supporting common PDB operations.

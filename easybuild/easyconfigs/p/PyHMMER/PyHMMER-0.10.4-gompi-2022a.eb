HMMER is a biological sequence analysis tool that uses profile hidden Markov    
models to search for sequence homologs. HMMER3 is developed and maintained by   
the Eddy/Rivas Laboratory at Harvard University.

pyhmmer is a Python package, implemented using the Cython language, that        
provides bindings to HMMER3. It directly interacts with the HMMER internals,    
which has the following advantages over CLI wrappers (like hmmer-py)"""

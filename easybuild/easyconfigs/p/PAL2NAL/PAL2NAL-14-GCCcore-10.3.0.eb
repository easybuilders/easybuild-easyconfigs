description = """PAL2NAL is a program that converts a multiple sequence alignment of proteins and
 the corresponding DNA (or mRNA) sequences into a codon alignment. The program automatically
 assigns the corresponding codon sequence even if the input DNA sequence has mismatches with the
 input protein sequence, or contains UTRs, polyA tails. It can also deal with frame shifts in the
 input alignment, which is suitable for the analysis of pseudogenes. The resulting codon alignment
 can further be subjected to the calculation of synonymous (d_S) and non-synonymous (d_N) subs-
 titution rates.

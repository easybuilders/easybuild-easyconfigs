description = """ProFit (pronounced Pro-Fit, not profit!) is designed to be the ultimate program for
 performing least squares fits of two or more protein structures. It performs a very simple and
 basic function, but allows as much flexibility as possible in performing this procedure. Thus one
 can specify subsets of atoms to be considered, specify zones to be fitted by number, sequence, or
 by sequence alignment.

 Comparison of Protein Structures', Acta Cryst A38, 871-873) as implemented in the program ProFit

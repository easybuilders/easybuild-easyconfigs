primitives. PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto.
PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like OpenSSL. To the
largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python. Only the
pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers) are
implemented as C extensions.
This module installs the 'Cryptodome' python package.

# - the pip package 'pycryptodome' which provides the 'Crypto' python module
# - the pip package 'pycryptodomex' which provides the 'Cryptodome' python module

# This easyconfig installs 'pycryptodomex' and 'Cryptdome'.
# Python-bundle-PyPI already provides the 'pycryptodome' variant.

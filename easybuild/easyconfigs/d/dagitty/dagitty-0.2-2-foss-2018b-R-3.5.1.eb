analyzing structural causal models (also known as directed acyclic graphs or DAGs). This package 
computes covariate adjustment sets for estimating causal effects, enumerates instrumental variables, 
derives testable implications (d-separation and vanishing tetrads), generates equivalent models, and 
includes a simple facility for data simulation."""

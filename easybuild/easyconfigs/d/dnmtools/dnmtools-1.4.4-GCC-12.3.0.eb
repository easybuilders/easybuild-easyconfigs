DNMTools is a set of tools for analyzing DNA methylation data from high-throughput sequencing experiments, especially whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), but also reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). These tools focus on overcoming the computing challenges imposed by the scale of genome-wide DNA methylation data, which is usually the early parts of data analysis.

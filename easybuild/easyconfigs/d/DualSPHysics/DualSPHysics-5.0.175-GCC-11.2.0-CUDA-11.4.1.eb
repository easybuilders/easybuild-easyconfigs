description = """DualSPHysics is based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model named SPHysics.

 The code is developed to study free-surface flow phenomena where Eulerian methods
 can be difficult to apply, such as waves or impact of dam-breaks on off-shore
 structures. DualSPHysics is a set of C++, CUDA and Java codes designed to deal
 with real-life engineering problems."""

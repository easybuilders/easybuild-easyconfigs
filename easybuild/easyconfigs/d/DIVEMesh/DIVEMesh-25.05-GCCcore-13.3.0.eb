REEF3D and its dependency DIVEMesh are hydrodynamics frameworks that offers
open-source CFD and wave models.  The software is efficiently parallelized,
designed to run on a large number of processors. High-order spatial and
temporal discretization schemes result in accurate and stable numerical
behavior. The modular programming approach allows the framework to incorporate
a range of different flow solvers which together represent all relevant length
scales. With a focus on coastal, marine and hydraulic engineering flows,
tailor-made multiphysics solvers are available for a range of relevant
problems (e.g. sediment transport or floating body dynamics).

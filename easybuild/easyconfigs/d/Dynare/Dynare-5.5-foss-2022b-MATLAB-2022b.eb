description = """Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models,
in particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping generations (OLG)
models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on the rational expectations
hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations about the future in a way consistent
with the model. But Dynare is also able to handle models where expectations are formed
differently: on one extreme, models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the
other extreme, models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning process."""

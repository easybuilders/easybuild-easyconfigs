description = """
This is a rewrite of DSSP, now offering full mmCIF support. The difference with previous
releases of DSSP is that it now writes out an annotated mmCIF file by default, storing the
secondary structure information in the _struct_conf category.

Another new feature in this version of DSSP is that it now defines Poly-Proline helices as well.

The DSSP program was designed by Wolfgang Kabsch and Chris Sander to standardize secondary
structure assignment. DSSP is a database of secondary structure assignments (and much more)
for all protein entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). DSSP is also the program that
calculates DSSP entries from PDB entries.

DSSP does not predict secondary structure.

description = """NVIDIA® Nsight™ Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications. It provides detailed
performance metrics and API debugging via a user interface and a command line tool. In addition, its baseline feature
allows users to compare results within the tool. Nsight Compute provides a customizable and data-driven user interface
and fast metric collection, which can be extended with rules-based analysis scripts for post-processing results. The
rules-based guided analysis helps isolate and fix memory throughput, compute, and occupancy inefficiencies in the target
application."""

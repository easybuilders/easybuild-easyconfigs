their ability to treat large scientific computational chemistry problems efficiently, and in their use of available
parallel computing resources from high-performance parallel supercomputers to conventional workstation clusters.
NWChem software can handle: biomolecules, nanostructures, and solid-state; from quantum to classical, and all
combinations; Gaussian basis functions or plane-waves; scaling from one to thousands of processors; properties
and relativity."""

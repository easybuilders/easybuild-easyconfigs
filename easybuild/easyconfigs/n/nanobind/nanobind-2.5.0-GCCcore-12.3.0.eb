Nanobind is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice 
versa. It is reminiscent of Boost.Python and pybind11 and uses near-identical 
syntax. In contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is more efficient: 
bindings compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and 
have better runtime performance.

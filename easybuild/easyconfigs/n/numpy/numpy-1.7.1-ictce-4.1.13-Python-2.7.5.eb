description = """NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
 a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran
 code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. Besides its obvious scientific uses,
 NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be 
 defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases."""

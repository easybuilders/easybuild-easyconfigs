description = """The numexpr package evaluates multiple-operator array expressions many times faster than NumPy can.
 It accepts the expression as a string, analyzes it, rewrites it more efficiently, and compiles it on the fly into
 code for its internal virtual machine (VM). Due to its integrated just-in-time (JIT) compiler, it does not require a
 compiler at runtime."""

description = """MetaMDBG is a fast and low-memory assembler for long and accurate metagenomics reads (e.g. PacBio
 HiFi, Nanopore r10.4). It is based on the minimizer de-Bruijn graph (MDBG), which have been reimplemented specifically
 for metagenomics assembly. MetaMDBG combines an efficient multi-k approach in minimizer-space for dealing with uneven
 species coverages, and a novel abundance-based filtering method for simplifying strain complexity."""

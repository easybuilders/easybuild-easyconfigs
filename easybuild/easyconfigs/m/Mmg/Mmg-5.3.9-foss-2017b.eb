Mmg is an open source software for simplicial remeshing. It provides 3 applications and 4 libraries:
    the mmg2d application and the libmmg2d library: adaptation and optimization of a two-dimensional triangulation
        and generation of a triangulation from a set of points or from given boundary edges
    the mmgs application and the libmmgs library: adaptation and optimization of a surface triangulation
        and isovalue discretization
    the mmg3d application and the libmmg3d library: adaptation and optimization of a tetrahedral mesh
        and implicit domain meshing
    the libmmg library gathering the libmmg2d, libmmgs and libmmg3d libraries

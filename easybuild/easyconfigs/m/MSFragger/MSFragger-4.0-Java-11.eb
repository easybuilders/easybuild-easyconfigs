description = """MSFragger is an ultrafast database search tool for peptide identification
 in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. It has demonstrated excellent performance across a wide
 range of datasets and applications. MSFragger is suitable for standard shotgun proteomics
 analyses as well as large datasets (including timsTOF PASEF data), enzyme unconstrained
 searches (e.g., peptidome), open database searches (e.g., precursor mass tolerance set
 to hundreds of Daltons) for identification of modified peptides, and glycopeptide
 identification (N-linked and O-linked)."""

Molcas is an ab initio quantum chemistry software package developed by scientists
to be used by scientists. The basic philosophy is is to be able to treat general
electronic structures for molecules consisting of atoms from most of the periodic
table. As such, the primary focus of the package is on multiconfigurational methods
with applications typically connected to the treatment of highly degenerate states.

MOLCAS is proprietary software and requires a licence.
See here:

how to order and here:
https://www.molcas.org/documentation/manual/node14.html#SECTION03114000000000000000
how to download the source code.
Once downloaded by running the 'init' script, remove the directories 'bin' + 'otherversions',
and the files 'install.sh' + 'molcas.alt' and create molcas86.tar.gz.
The checksum will vary as some .git directories will get downloaded as well.
The full path to the licence.dat file needs to be set:
export MOLCAS_LICENSE=/path/to/file
to work!

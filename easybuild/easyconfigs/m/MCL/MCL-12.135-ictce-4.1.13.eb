 scalable unsupervised cluster algorithm for networks (also known as graphs) based on
 simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs. The algorithm was invented/discovered by
 Stijn van Dongen at the Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science (also known as CWI)
 in the Netherlands. MCL has been applied in a number of different domains, mostly in bioinformatics."""

 GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro processor. It is
 mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some extensions (for example, handling
 more than 9 positional parameters to macros). GNU M4 also has built-in
 functions for including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.

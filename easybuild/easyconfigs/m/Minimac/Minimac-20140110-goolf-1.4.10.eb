description = """ Minimac is a low memory, computationally efficient implementation 
 of the MaCH algorithm for genotype imputation. It is designed to work on phased genotypes
 and can handle very large reference panels with hundreds or thousands of haplotypes. 
 The name has two parts. The first, 'mini', refers to the modest amount of computational
 resources it requires. The second, 'mac', is short hand for MaCH, our widely used 
 algorithm for genotype imputation.  """

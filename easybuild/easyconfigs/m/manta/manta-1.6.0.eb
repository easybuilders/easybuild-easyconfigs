description = """ 
Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads.
It is optimized for analysis of germline variation in small sets of individuals and 
somatic variation in tumor/normal sample pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and 
scores large-scale SVs, medium-sized indels and large insertions within a 
single efficient workflow.

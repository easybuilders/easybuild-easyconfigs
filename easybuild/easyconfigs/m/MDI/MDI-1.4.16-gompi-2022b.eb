description = """The MolSSI Driver Interface (MDI) project provides a 
standardized API for fast, on-the-fly communication between computational 
chemistry codes. This greatly simplifies the process of implementing 
methods that require the cooperation of multiple software packages and 
enables developers to write a single implementation that works across 
many different codes. The API is sufficiently general to support a wide 
variety of techniques, including QM/MM, ab initio MD, machine learning, 
advanced sampling, and path integral MD, while also being straightforwardly 
extensible. Communication between codes is handled by the MDI Library, which 
enables tight coupling between codes using either the MPI or TCP/IP methods.

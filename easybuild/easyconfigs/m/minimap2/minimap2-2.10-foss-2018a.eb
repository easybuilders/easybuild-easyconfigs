description = """Minimap2 is a fast sequence mapping and alignment program that can find overlaps between
 long noisy reads, or map long reads or their assemblies to a reference genome optionally with detailed
 alignment (i.e. CIGAR). At present, it works efficiently with query sequences from a few kilobases to
 ~100 megabases in length at an error rate ~15%. Minimap2 outputs in the PAF or the SAM format. On limited
 test data sets, minimap2 is over 20 times faster than most other long-read aligners. It will replace
 BWA-MEM for long reads and contig alignment."""

description = """MOFA is a factor analysis model that provides a general framework
 for the integration of multi-omic data sets in an unsupervised fashion. Intuitively,
 MOFA can be viewed as a versatile and statistically rigorous generalization of principal
 component analysis to multi-omics data. Given several data matrices with measurements
 of multiple -omics data types on the same or on overlapping sets of samples,
 MOFA infers an interpretable low-dimensional representation in terms of a few latent factors.
 These learnt factors represent the driving sources of variation across data modalities,
 thus facilitating the identification of cellular states or disease subgroups."""

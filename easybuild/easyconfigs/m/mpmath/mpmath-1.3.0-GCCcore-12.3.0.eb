 types and math/cmath modules, but also does much more advanced mathematics. Almost any calculation
 can be performed just as well at 10-digit or 1000-digit precision, with either real or complex
 numbers, and in many cases mpmath implements efficient algorithms that scale well for extremely
 high precision work."""

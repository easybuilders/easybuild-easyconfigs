# major part of this list was determined from espresso/install/plugins_list
# - There is currently no plumed version that works for QME 6.2
# - Yambo is better to install outside of QM-E, there are problems
#   building it with openmp turned on and the intel toolchain and there is
#   no added benefit to build it inside QM-E
# - Want is never installed in bin/ (since it first shows up in 4.2) so
#   don't bother building it here.

# Manual download required, qe-forge doesn't exist any longer.
# The qe tar file from github for 6.2 has a different top level directory name
# than the olfd qe-forge tarfile did and the easyblock expects the old name.

# major part of this list was determined from espresso/install/plugins_list
# - There is currently no plumed version that works for QME 6.1
# - Yambo is better to install outside of QM-E, there are problems
#   building it with openmp turned on and the intel toolchain and there is
#   no added benefit to build it inside QM-E
# - Want is never installed in bin/ (since it first shows up in 4.2) so
#   don't bother building it here.

# OpenSSL can be finely controled with 'minimum_openssl_version' (defaults to
# easyconfig version).
# If the host system does not have this version of OpenSSL (or with the option
# wrap_system_openssl = False), EasyBuild will fall back to the following
# component list, which will be build and installed as usual.

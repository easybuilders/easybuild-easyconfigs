Analysis solutions for nanopore sequencing data
Nanopore sequencing presents a number of significant advantages which allow the sequencing process to be tailored to your r
equirements:
    Real-time basecalling, enabling immediate access to results
    Stop sequencing as soon as sufficient data has been obtained
    Stop, wash and reuse a flow cell
    Onboard basecalling with Guppy means that neither a local infrastructure nor a stable internet connection is needed
    The nanopore sequencing analysis workflow is simple and easy to follow: with five steps from raw data acquisition to analys
    is completion and experimental interpretation. From the moment data acquisition begins, analysis can be performed in real t
    ime. As detailed on this page, Oxford Nanopore provides solutions at each stage.

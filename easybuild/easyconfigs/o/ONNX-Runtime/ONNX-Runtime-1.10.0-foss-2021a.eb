supporting models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and
TensorFlow/Keras as well as classical machine learning libraries such as
scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. ONNX Runtime is compatible with different
hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by
leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations
and transforms."""

 specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable and scalable multicast protocol
 that enables receivers to detect loss, request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application
 of unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the receiver is responsible
 for ensuring all data is received, absolving the sender of reception responsibility."""

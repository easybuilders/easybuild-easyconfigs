OpenKIM is an API and a collection of interatomic models (potentials) for
atomistic simulations.  It is a library that can be used by simulation programs
to get access to the models in the OpenKIM database.

This EasyBuild only installs the API, the models have to be installed
by the user by running
    kim-api-v2-collections-management install user MODELNAME
or
    kim-api-v2-collections-management install user OpenKIM
to install them all.

description = """ BUGS is a software package for performing Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling. 
 The user specifies a statistical model, of (almost) arbitrary complexity, by simply stating the 
 relationships between related variables. The software includes an ‘expert system’, which determines 
 an appropriate MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) scheme (based on the Gibbs sampler) for analysing 
 the specified model. The user then controls the execution of the scheme and is free to choose 
 from a wide range of output types.  """

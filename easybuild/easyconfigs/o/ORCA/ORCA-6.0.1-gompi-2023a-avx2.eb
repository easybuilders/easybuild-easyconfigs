ORCA is a flexible, efficient and easy-to-use general purpose tool for quantum
chemistry with specific emphasis on spectroscopic properties of open-shell
molecules. It features a wide variety of standard quantum chemical methods
ranging from semiempirical methods to DFT to single- and multireference
correlated ab initio methods. It can also treat environmental and relativistic
effects."""

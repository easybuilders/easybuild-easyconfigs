description = """AreTomo2, a multi-GPU accelerated software package that fully automates motion- 
corrected marker-free tomographic alignment and reconstruction, now includes    
robust GPU-accelerated CTF (Contrast Transfer Function) estimation in a single  
package. AreTomo2 is part of our endeavor to build a fully-automated high-      
throughput processing pipeline that enables real-time reconstruction of         
tomograms in parallel with tomographic data collection. It strives to be fast   
and accurate, as well as provides for easy integration into subtomogram         
processing workflows by generating IMod compatible files containing alignment   
and CTF parameters needed to bootstrap subtomogram averaging. AreTomo2 can also 
be used for on-the-fly reconstruction of tomograms and CTF estimation in        
parallel with tilt series collection, enabling real-time assessment of sample   
quality and adjustment of collection parameters"""

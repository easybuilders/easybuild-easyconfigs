ADIOS2 is developed as part of the United States Department of Energy's Exascale Computing
Project. It is a framework for scientific data I/O to publish and subscribe to data when
and where required.
ADIOS2 transports data as groups of self-describing variables and attributes across different
media types (such as files, wide-area-networks, and remote direct memory access) using a
common application programming interface for all transport modes. ADIOS2 can be used on
supercomputers, cloud systems, and personal computers. """

The CUDA_VERSION returned by CMake's FindCUDA module only contains
the major and minor version number, not the patch release.
This makes the check if CUDA_VERSION is less than 11.4.1 broken,
even though only CUDA 11.4.1 supports GCC 11 (11.4.0 does not).
As we know which GCC and CUDA we're using, this patch just compares it to 11.4 anyway.

description = """
Auto-WEKA considers the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning
algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous methods that
address these issues in isolation. Auto-WEKA does this using a fully automated
approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Our hope is
that Auto-WEKA will help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine
learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their
applications, and hence to achieve improved performance."""

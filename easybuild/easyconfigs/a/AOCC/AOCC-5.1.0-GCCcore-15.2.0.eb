description = """
The AOCC compiler is designed for high-performance x86 CPU compilation of C,
C++, and Fortran programming languages. It offers target-dependent and
target-independent optimizations, with a particular focus on AMD "Zen"
processors. These optimizations provide performance advantage for time-critical
applications, especially in the field of high-performance computing (HPC). The
AOCC compiler environment streamlines and speeds up the development and tuning
process for x86 applications written in C, C++, and Fortran.

description = """ AutoDock is a suite of automated docking tools. It is designed to 
 predict how small molecules, such as substrates or drug candidates, bind to a receptor 
 of known 3D structure. 
 AutoDock 4 actually consists of two main programs: 
 autodock performs the docking of the ligand to a set of grids describing the target protein; 
 autogrid pre-calculates these grids."""

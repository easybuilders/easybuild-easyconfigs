# Running the CMake build, the metadata for the python package isn't generated
# A
# pip install . --prefix=installdir
# would resolve this, but the downside is that the official setup.py will _also_ trigger a rebuild
# for all the C-libraries. This patch will ensure we only generate the python metadata for this package
# The metadata is needed for other pip-installs to identify that this package is already installed
# which will avoid e.g. users duplicating everybeam in a virtualenv when they already have
# this module loaded
#
# Note that this patch require a directory 'everybeam' to be created in the builddir with
# mkdir -p %(builddir)s/EveryBeam/everybeam

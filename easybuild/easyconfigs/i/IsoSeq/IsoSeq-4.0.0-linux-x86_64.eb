description = """IsoSeq v3 contains the newest tools to identify transcripts
 in PacBio single-molecule sequencing data. Starting in SMRT 
 Link v6.0.0, those tools power the IsoSeq GUI-based analysis 
 application. A composable workflow of existing tools and
 algorithms, combined with a new clustering technique, allows
 to process the ever-increasing yield of PacBio machines with
 similar performance to IsoSeq versions 1 and 2. Starting with 
 version 3.4, support for UMI and cell barcode based 
 deduplication has been added.

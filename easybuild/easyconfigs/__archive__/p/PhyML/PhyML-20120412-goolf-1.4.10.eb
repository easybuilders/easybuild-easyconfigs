description = """ PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood 
 phylogenies from alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. 
 The main strength of PhyML lies in the large number of substitution 
 models coupled to various options to search the space of phylogenetic 
 tree topologies, going from very fast and efficient methods to slower 
 but generally more accurate approaches. PhyML was designed to process 
 moderate to large data sets. In theory, alignments with up to 4,000 
 sequences 2,000,000 character-long can be processed. """

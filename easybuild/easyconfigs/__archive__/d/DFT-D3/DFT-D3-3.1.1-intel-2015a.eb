# numbering. Also, the authors are prone (alas) to stealth upgrades, so that two
# tarballs with the same version number can have different checksums. For this
# reason, it is suggested to manually download and rename the tarball. The
# checksum may also need updating from time to time.
# Checksum last updated: 15 April 2016
# Date tarball was reported to have been modified: 11 January 2016

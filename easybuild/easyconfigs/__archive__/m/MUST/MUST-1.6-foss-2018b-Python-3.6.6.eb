 As MPI calls are complex and usage errors common, this functionality is extremely helpful for application developers
 that want to develop correct MPI applications.
 This includes errors that already manifest – segmentation faults or incorrect results – as well as many errors
 that are not visible to the application developer or do not manifest on a certain system or MPI implementation."""

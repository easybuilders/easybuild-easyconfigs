description = """KEALib provides an implementation of the GDAL data model. The
format supports raster attribute tables, image pyramids, meta-data and in-built
statistics while also handling very large files and compression throughout.
Based on the HDF5 standard, it also provides a base from which other formats
can be derived and is a good choice for long term data archiving. An
independent software library (libkea) provides complete access to the KEA image
format and a GDAL driver allowing KEA images to be used from any GDAL supported
software."""

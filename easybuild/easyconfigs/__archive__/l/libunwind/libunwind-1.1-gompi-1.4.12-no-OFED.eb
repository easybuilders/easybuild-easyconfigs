description = """The primary goal of this project is to define a portable and efficient C
 programming interface (API) to determine the call-chain of a program. The API
 additionally provides the means to manipulate the preserved (callee-saved) state of each
 call-frame and to resume execution at any point in the call-chain (non-local goto).
 The API supports both local (same-process) and remote (across-process) operation."""

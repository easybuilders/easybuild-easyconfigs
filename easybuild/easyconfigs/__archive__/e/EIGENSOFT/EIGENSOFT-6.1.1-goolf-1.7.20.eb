description = """The EIGENSOFT package combines functionality from our population genetics methods (Patterson et al.
 2006) and our EIGENSTRAT stratification correction method (Price et al. 2006). The EIGENSTRAT method uses principal
 components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls along continuous axes of
 variation; the resulting correction is specific to a candidate markerâ€™s variation in frequency across ancestral
 populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. The EIGENSOFT
 package has a built-in plotting script and supports multiple file formats and quantitative phenotypes."""

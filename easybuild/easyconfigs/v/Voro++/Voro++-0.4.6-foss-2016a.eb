description = """Voro++ is a software library for carrying out three-dimensional computations of the Voronoi
tessellation. A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library is that it carries out cell-based calculations,
computing the Voronoi cell for each particle individually. It is particularly well-suited for applications that
rely on cell-based statistics, where features of Voronoi cells (eg. volume, centroid, number of faces) can be used
to analyze a system of particles."""

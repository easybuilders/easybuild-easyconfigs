description = """verifyBamID is a software that verifies whether the reads in particular file match previously known 
 genotypes for an individual (or group of individuals), and checks whether the reads are contaminated as a mixture of 
 two samples. verifyBamID can detect sample contamination and swaps when external genotypes are available. When 
 external genotypes are not available, verifyBamID still robustly detects sample swaps.

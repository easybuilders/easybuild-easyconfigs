 Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based
 on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed,
 runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine,
 and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection,
 making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping."""

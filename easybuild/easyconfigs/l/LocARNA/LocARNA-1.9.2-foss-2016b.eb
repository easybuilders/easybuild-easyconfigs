description = """LocARNA is a collection of alignment tools for the structural analysis of RNA.
 Given a set of RNA sequences, LocARNA simultaneously aligns and predicts common structures for
 your RNAs. In this way, LocARNA performs Sankoff-like alignment and is in particular suited for
 analyzing sets of related RNAs without known common structure."""

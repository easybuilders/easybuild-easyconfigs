 Biosciences (PacBio) SMRT and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). It takes as input an aligned BAM file and outputs
 a phased VCF file with variants and haplotype information. It can also output haplotype-separated BAM files that can
 be used for downstream analysis. Currently, it only calls single nucleotide variants (SNVs)."""

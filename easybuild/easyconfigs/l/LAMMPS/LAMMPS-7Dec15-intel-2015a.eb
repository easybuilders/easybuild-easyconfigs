description = """LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronym
for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator. LAMMPS has
potentials for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) and soft matter
(biomolecules, polymers) and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems. It can be
used to model atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at
the atomic, meso, or continuum scale. LAMMPS runs on single processors or in
parallel using message-passing techniques and a spatial-decomposition of the
simulation domain. The code is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
functionality."""

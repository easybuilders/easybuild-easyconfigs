description = """The LISFLOOD-FP is a raster-based hydrodynamic model originally developed by
the University of Bristol. It has undergone extensive development since
conception and includes a collection of numerical schemes implemented to solve
a variety of mathematical approximations of the 2D shallow water equations of
different complexity.
The local inertia solver, known as the ACC solver, is widely used to simulate
floods with gradually-varying, subcritical flow over sufficiently rough
surfaces with Manningâ€™s coefficient of at least 0.03. It has a version with
CPU-specific optimisations and enhanced with a subgrid channel model.
LISFLOOD-FP also includes second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) and
first-order finite volume (FV1) solvers of the full shallow water equations for
modelling a wide range of flows, including rapidly-propagating, supercritical
flows, shock waves, or flows over very smooth surfaces. The DG2/FV1 solvers are
parallelised for the multi-core CPU architecture, but do not integrate with the
subgrid channel model nor with the CPU-specific optimisations.

# Allow WRF source code directory to be located in EasyBuild module tree
# ============================================================================
# Since WPS v4.0, the WPS build system seems to make strong assumptions on 
# where to find the WRF source code.  This patch allows the WRF source code to
# be found also when WRF is located in the EasyBuild module tree.  $WRF_DIR_PRE 
# is being set from the wps EasyBlock.
# Patch written by @andreas-h (Oct 2018)

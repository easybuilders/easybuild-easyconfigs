Rapidcsv is a C++ header-only library for CSV parsing. 
While the name admittedly was inspired by the rapidjson project, 
the objectives are not the same. The goal of rapidcsv is to be 
an easy-to-use CSV library enabling rapid development. 
For optimal performance (be it CPU or memory usage) a CSV parser 
implemented for the specific use-case is likely to be more performant.

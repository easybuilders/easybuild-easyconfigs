# In that case make sure to include a Python as builddependency. 
# This Python should not be too new: it's dependencies like for example on ncursus should be compatible with R's dependencies.
# For example Python 2.7.11 is too new as it requires ncurses 6.0 whereas our R requires ncurses 5.9.
# The alternative is to replace the https URLs with http URLs in the generated EasyConfig.

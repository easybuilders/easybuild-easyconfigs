description = """ RNAsequel runs as a post-processing step on top of an RNA-seq aligner 
 and systematically detects and corrects many common alignment artifacts. Its key innovations 
 are a two-pass splice junction detection system that combines de novo splice junction prediction 
 with a splice junction database, and the use of an empirically determined estimate of the fragment 
 size distribution for use in resolving read pairs. """

description = """RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences.
 The output of the program is a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence as well as a modified 
 version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked (default: replaced by Ns). Currently over 56%
 of human genomic sequence is identified and masked by the program. Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker are performed by one of
 several popular search engines including nhmmer, cross_match, ABBlast/WUBlast, RMBlast and Decypher. RepeatMasker makes use of
 curated libraries of repeats and currently supports Dfam ( profile HMM library derived from Repbase sequences ) and Repbase, a
 service of the Genetic Information Research Institute."""

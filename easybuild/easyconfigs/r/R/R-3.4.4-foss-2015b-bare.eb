# NOTE: LAPACK support is built into BLAS, which will be detected correctly when LAPACK_LIBS is *not* specified.

#           External libraries: ...., BLAS(OpenBLAS), LAPACK(in blas), ....

# specify that at least EasyBuild v3.5.0 is required,
# since we rely on the updated EasyBlock for R to configure correctly w.r.t. 
# BLAS/LAPACK, TCL/TK, X11 and graphics capabilities. 
# Hence the following configure options are no longer required in the EasyConfig as of EasyBuild >= 3.5.0:
# --with-lapack --with-blas
# --with-x=yes/no
# --with-tcl-config=$EBROOTTCL/lib/tclConfig.sh --with-tk-config=$EBROOTTK/lib/tkConfig.sh

# You may need to include a more recent Python to download R packages from HTTPS based URLs
# when the Python that comes with your OS is too old and you encounter:
#     SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure
# In that case make sure to include a Python as builddependency. 
# This Python should not be too new: it's dependencies like for example on ncursus should be compatible with R's dependencies.
# For example Python 2.7.11 is too new as it requires ncurses 6.0 whereas our R requires ncurses 5.9.
# The alternative is to replace the https URLs with http URLs in the generated EasyConfig.

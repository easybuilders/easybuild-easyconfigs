description = """The rootpy project is a community-driven initiative aiming to provide a more pythonic interface with 
ROOT on top of the existing PyROOT bindings. Given Pythonâ€™s reflective and dynamic nature, rootpy also aims to 
improve ROOT design flaws and supplement existing ROOT functionality. The scientific Python community also offers a 
multitude of powerful packages such as SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and PyTables, but a suitable interface 
between them and ROOT has been lacking. rootpy provides the interfaces and conversion mechanisms required to liberate 
your data and to take advantage of these alternatives if needed."""

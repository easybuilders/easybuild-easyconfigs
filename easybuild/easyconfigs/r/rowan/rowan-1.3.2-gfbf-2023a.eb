Rowan, a package for working with quaternions! Quaternions, which form a
number system with various interesting properties, were originally developed
for classical mechanics. Although they have since been largely displaced
from this application by vector mathematics, they have become a standard
method of representing rotations in three dimensions. Quaternions are now
commonly used for this purpose in various fields, including computer graphics
and attitude control."""

description = """
HyperQueue is a tool designed to simplify execution of large workflows (task graphs) on HPC clusters.
It allows you to execute a large number of tasks in a simple way, without having to manually submit jobs
into batch schedulers like Slurm or PBS. 

You just specify what you want to compute â€“ HyperQueue will automatically ask for computational resources and 
dynamically load-balance tasks across all allocated nodes and cores.
HyperQueue can also work without Slurm/PBS as a general task executor.

description = """HISAT is a fast and sensitive spliced alignment program for mapping RNA-seq reads. In addition to one 
 global FM index that represents a whole genome, HISAT uses a large set of small FM indexes that collectively cover 
 the whole genome (each index represents a genomic region of ~64,000 bp and ~48,000 indexes are needed to cover the 
 human genome). These small indexes (called local indexes) combined with several alignment strategies enable effective 
 alignment of RNA-seq reads, in particular, reads spanning multiple exons. The memory footprint of HISAT is relatively 
 low (~4.3GB for the human genome). We have developed HISAT based on the Bowtie2 implementation to handle most of the 
 operations on the FM index. """

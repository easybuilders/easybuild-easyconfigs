 hyperparameters of that system so they can be easily examined and modified. We add a
 few useful extensions to a popular human-readable data-serialization language known as
 YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language). This provides support for a rather expansive idea
 of what constitutes a hyperparameter, and cleans up python files for data analysis to
 just the bare algorithm."""

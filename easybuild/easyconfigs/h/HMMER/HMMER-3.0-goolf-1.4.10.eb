description = """HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs of protein sequences,
  and for making protein sequence alignments. It implements methods using probabilistic models
  called profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs).  Compared to BLAST, FASTA, and other
  sequence alignment and database search tools based on older scoring methodology,
  HMMER aims to be significantly more accurate and more able to detect remote homologs
  because of the strength of its underlying mathematical models. In the past, this strength
  came at significant computational expense, but in the new HMMER3 project, HMMER is now
  essentially as fast as BLAST."""

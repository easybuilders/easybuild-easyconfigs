description = """HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) is a suite of tools for Motif Discovery and 
 next-gen sequencing analysis.  It is a collection of command line programs for unix-style operating systems written in
 Perl and C++. HOMER was primarily written as a de novo motif discovery algorithm and is well suited for finding 8-20 
 bp motifs in large scale genomics data.  HOMER contains many useful tools for analyzing ChIP-Seq, GRO-Seq, RNA-Seq, 
 DNase-Seq, Hi-C and numerous other types of functional genomics sequencing data sets."""

a suite of tools for Motif Discovery and next-gen sequencing analysis.  It
is a collection of command line programs for UNIX-style operating systems
written in Perl and C++.  HOMER was primarily written as a de novo motif
discovery algorithm and is well suited for finding 8-20 bp motifs in large
scale genomics data.  HOMER contains many useful tools for analyzing
ChIP-Seq, GRO-Seq, RNA-Seq, DNase-Seq, Hi-C and numerous other types of
functional genomics sequencing data sets."""

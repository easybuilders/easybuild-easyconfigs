# fastStructure is a Python program structure.py, which 
# integrates with some C code using Cython. This
# easyconfig calls setup.py to build the Cython code and
# copies the whole tree over to the installation directory.
# The '#!/bin/env python' header is added to structure.py,
# and it is made executable in order for the users to be able
# to use it without having to refer to its full path.

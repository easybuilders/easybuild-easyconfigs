 new Python frontend. Meanwhile it has evolved into a new build system, which
 retains most of the features found in Boost.Build, but with (hopefully !) much
 simplified logic, in addition of course to using Python as scripting language,
 rather than Jam. The original bjam engine is still in use as scheduler, though
 at this point that is mostly an implementation detail."""

# no direct download url. The download has been done with git
# in addition the tagged version 1.1.0 didn't compile properly, missing function
# definitions to functions within the freebayes code base. I have found that
# the current master HEAD (commit: d784cf8f4fdbf8200aa1b45e8a81dcd500b15efb)
# does build correctly. To ensure any future builds use this version also I have

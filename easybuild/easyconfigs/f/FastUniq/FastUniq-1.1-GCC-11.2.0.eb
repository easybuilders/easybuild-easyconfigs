short DNA sequence reads in FASTQ format. FastUniq identifies duplicates
by comparing sequences between read pairs and does not require complete
genome sequences as prerequisites. FastUniq is capable of simultaneously
handling reads with different lengths and results in highly efficient
running time."""

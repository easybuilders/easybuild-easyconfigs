description = """FastK is a kâ€‘mer counter that is optimized for processing high quality DNA assembly data sets
 such as those produced with an Illumina instrument or a PacBio run in HiFi mode. For example it is about 2 times
 faster than KMC3 when counting 40-mers in a 50X HiFi data set. Its relative speedup decreases with increasing error
 rate or increasing values of k, but regardless is a general program that works for any DNA sequence data set
 and choice of k. It is further designed to handle data sets of arbitrarily large size, e.g. a 100X data
 set of a 32GB Axolotl genome (3.2Tbp) can be performed on a machine with just 12GB of memory provided it
 has ~6.5TB of disk space available."""

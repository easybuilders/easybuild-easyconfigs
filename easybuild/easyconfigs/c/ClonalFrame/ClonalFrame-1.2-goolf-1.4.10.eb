description = """ ClonalFrame is a computer package for the inference of bacterial 
 microevolution using multilocus sequence data. In a nutshell, ClonalFrame identifies 
 the clonal relationships between the members of a sample, while also estimating the 
 chromosomal position of homologous recombination events that have disrupted the clonal 
 inheritance. 

 xmfa2struct is a program written in C which converts files in eXtended Multi-Fasta format 
 (XMFA, the input format of ClonalFrame) into the input file format of Structure. """

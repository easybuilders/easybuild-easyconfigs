 writing plotting applications at all levels of complexity,
 from simple scripts with hard-coded data to large plotting programs
 with complex data interrelationships and a multitude of interactive tools.
 While Chaco generates attractive static plots for publication and presentation,
 it also works well for interactive data visualization and exploration."""

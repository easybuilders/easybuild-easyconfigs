 sequencing (such as the PacBio RS II or Oxford Nanopore MinION).

 Canu is a hierarchical assembly pipeline which runs in four steps:

     Detect overlaps in high-noise sequences using MHAP
     Generate corrected sequence consensus
     Trim corrected sequences
     Assemble trimmed corrected sequences

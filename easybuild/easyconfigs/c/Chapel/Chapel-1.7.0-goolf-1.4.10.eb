description = """ Chapel is an emerging parallel programming language whose design and development
 is being led by Cray Inc. Chapel is designed to improve the productivity of high-end computer users
 while also serving as a portable parallel programming model that can be used on commodity clusters
 or desktop multicore systems. Chapel strives to vastly improve the programmability of large-scale
 parallel computers while matching or beating the performance and portability of current programming
 models like MPI."""

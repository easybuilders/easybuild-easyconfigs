description = """This library supports both MCL, a cluster algorithm for graphs, and zoem, a
macro/DSL language. It supplies abstractions for memory management, I/O,
associative arrays, strings, heaps, and a few other things. The string library
has had heavy testing as part of zoem. Both understandably and regrettably I
chose long ago to make it C-string-compatible, hence nul bytes may not be part
of a string. At some point I hope to rectify this, perhaps unrealistically."""

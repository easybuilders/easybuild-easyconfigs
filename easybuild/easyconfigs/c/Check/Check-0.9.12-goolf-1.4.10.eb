description = """ Check is a unit testing framework for C. It features a simple interface 
 for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer. Tests are run in a 
 separate address space, so both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation 
 faults or other signals can be caught. Test results are reportable in the following: 
 Subunit, TAP, XML, and a generic logging format."""

 Cube, which is used as performance report explorer for Scalasca and Score-P,
 is a generic tool for displaying a multi-dimensional performance space
 consisting of the dimensions (i) performance metric, (ii) call path, and
 (iii) system resource. Each dimension can be represented as a tree, where
 non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed or expanded to achieve the
 desired level of granularity.

 This module provides the Cube high-performance C writer library component.

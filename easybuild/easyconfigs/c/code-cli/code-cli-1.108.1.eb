description = """
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs
on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with
built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich
ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#,
Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET). Begin your journey with VS Code with these
introductory videos.

This module provides the command-line interface of Visual Studio Code that lets
you control how you launch the editor. You can open files, install extensions,
change the display language, and output diagnostics through command-line options.

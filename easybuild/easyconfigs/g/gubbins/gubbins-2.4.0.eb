Gubbins (Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences)
is an algorithm that iteratively identifies loci containing elevated densities of base
substitutions while concurrently constructing a phylogeny based on the putative point mutations
outside of these regions. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate
reconstructions under realistic models of short-term bacterial evolution, and can be run
in only a few hours on alignments of hundreds of bacterial genome sequences.

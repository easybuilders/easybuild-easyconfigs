description = """The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython that
supports micro-threads called "tasklets". Tasklets run pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single
or a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized with data exchanges on "channels".
A "greenlet", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of micro-thread with no implicit
scheduling; coroutines, in other words. This is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs.

 supports micro-threads called 'tasklets'. Tasklets run pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single
 or a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized with data exchanges on 'channels'.
 A 'greenlet', on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of micro-thread with no implicit
 scheduling; coroutines, in other words. This is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs."""

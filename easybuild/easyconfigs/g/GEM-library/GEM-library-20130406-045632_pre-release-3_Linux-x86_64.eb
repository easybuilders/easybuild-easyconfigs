description = """ Next-generation sequencing platforms (Illumina/Solexa, ABI/SOLiD, etc.) 
 call for powerful and very optimized tools to index/analyze huge genomes. The GEM library 
 strives to be a true "next-generation" tool for handling any kind of sequence data, offering 
 state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures specifically tailored to this demanding task. 
 At the moment, efficient indexing and searching algorithms based on the Burrows-Wheeler 
 transform (BWT) have been implemented. The library core is written in C for maximum speed, 
 with concise interfaces to higher-level programming languages like OCaml and Python. 
 Many high-performance standalone programs (mapper, splice mapper, etc.) are provided along 
 with the library; in general, new algorithms and tools can be easily implemented on the top of it. """

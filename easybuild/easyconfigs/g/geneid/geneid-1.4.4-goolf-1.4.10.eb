description = """ geneid is a program to predict genes in anonymous genomic sequences 
 designed with a hierarchical structure. In the first step, splice sites, start and stop 
 codons are predicted and scored along the sequence using Position Weight Arrays (PWAs). 
 In the second step, exons are built from the sites. Exons are scored as the sum of the 
 scores of the defining sites, plus the the log-likelihood ratio of a Markov Model for 
 coding DNA. Finally, from the set of predicted exons, the gene structure is assembled, 
 maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons."""

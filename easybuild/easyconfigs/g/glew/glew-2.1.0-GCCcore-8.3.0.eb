The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (GLEW) is a cross-platform 
open-source C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides 
efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL 
extensions are supported on the target platform. OpenGL 
core and extension functionality is exposed in a single header 
file. GLEW has been tested on a variety of operating systems, 
including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Irix, and Solaris."""

description = """Gkeyll v2.0 (pronounced as in the book “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll 
and Mr. Hyde”) is a computational plasma physics code mostly written in C/C++ and LuaJIT. 
Gkeyll contains solvers for gyrokinetic equations, Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and 
multi-fluid equations. Gkeyll contains ab-initio and novel implementations of a number 
of algorithms, and perhaps is unique in using a JIT compiled typeless dynamic language 
for as its main implementation language."""

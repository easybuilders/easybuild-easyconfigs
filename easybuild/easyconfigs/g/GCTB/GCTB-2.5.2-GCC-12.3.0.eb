GCTB is a software tool that comprises a family of Bayesian linear mixed models
for complex trait analyses using genome-wide SNPs. It was developed to
simultaneously estimate the joint effects of all SNPs and the genetic architecture
parameters for a complex trait, including SNP-based heritability, polygenicity and
the joint distribution of effect sizes and minor allele frequencies.

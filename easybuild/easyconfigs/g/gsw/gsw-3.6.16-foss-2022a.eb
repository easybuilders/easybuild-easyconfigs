description = """This Python implementation of the Thermodynamic Equation of 
Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based primarily on numpy ufunc wrappers of the GSW-C 
implementation. This library replaces the original python-gsw pure-python 
implementation.. The primary reasons for this change are that by building on 
the C implementation we reduce code duplication and we gain an immediate update 
to the 75-term equation.
Additional benefits include a major increase in speed, a reduction in memory 
usage, and the inclusion of more functions. The penalty is that a C 
(or MSVC C++ for Windows) compiler is required to build the package from source."""

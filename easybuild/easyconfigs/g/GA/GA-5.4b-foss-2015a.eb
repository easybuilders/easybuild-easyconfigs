description = """Global Arrays (GA) is a Partitioned Global Address Space
(PGAS) programming model. It provides primitives for one-sided communication
(Get, Put, Accumulate) and Atomic Operations (read increment). It supports
blocking and non-blocking primtives, and supports location consistency.
Starting GA v5.4, ARMCI has been deprecated and replaced with Communication
runtime for Extreme Scale (ComEx). GA uses ComEx to abstract inter-node
communication operations. The default ComEx ports use MPI --- which makes GA
and ComEx portable for high-end systems. Most ComEx implementations use on-node
shared memory for faster intra-node communication."""

# A recipe for GAMESS-US without interactive Easyblock
# 
# The recent version of GAMESS seem to not require actvte.x anymore
# So providing install.info as a patch seems to work. Change the patch for a given system.
# It is difficult to keep track of hardcoded Fortran options in the "comp" to make EB toolchain options work
# Therefore a CPU dispatch for linux64 ifort -axCORE-AVX512,etc etc is added as comp.patch
# For running GAMESS, rungms-dev is used, and copied over rungms. install.info should BTW refer to
# the final installation directory for it to work; thus at the build time, it is overridden 
# in the prebuild and make steps.
#
# OpenMPI should be 4.x , better 4.1, for mixed mode to work properly support for "yiel" is needed.
# The runmgs-dev patch contains hardcoded UCX pml and osc options! Remove/change depending on the fabric drivers used.# As an alternative, OMPI_ options may be added to install.info patch, which gets sourced by runmgs-dev.

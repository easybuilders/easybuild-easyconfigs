description = """
The Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) recommends banning certain C Library
functions because they directly contribute to security vulnerabilities such as
buffer overflows. However routines for the manipulation of strings and memory
buffers are common in software and firmware, and are essential to accomplish
certain programming tasks. Safer replacements for these functions that avoid or
prevent serious security vulnerabilities (e.g. buffer overflows, string format
attacks, conversion overflows/underflows, etc.) are available in the SafeString
Library."""

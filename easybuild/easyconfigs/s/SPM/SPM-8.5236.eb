# not sure it this is right 
# SPM compiles its modules with MATLABs mcc, which in turn depends on GCC.
# should probably change toolchain to GCC or goolf, because this config uses the
# system compiler. Didn't do that, because then dependency resolution
# tries to look for a MATLAB that has been built using a GCC/goolf toolchain.
# Now as I think about it this shouldn't be a problem - but what do I know?

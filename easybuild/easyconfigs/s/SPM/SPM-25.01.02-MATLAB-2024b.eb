description = """SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) refers to the construction
 and assessment of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypo-
 theses about functional imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in
 software that is called SPM.
 The SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain imaging
 data sequences. The sequences can be a series of images from different cohorts,
 or time-series from the same subject. The current release is designed for the
 analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG.

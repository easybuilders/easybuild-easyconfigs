description = """selscan -- a program to calculate EHH-based scans for positive selection in 
	genomes
selscan currently implements EHH, iHS, XP-EHH, nSL, and iHH12 and requires phased data. 
It should be run separately for each chromosome and population (or population 
pair for XP-EHH).  selscan is 'dumb' with respect ancestral/derived coding and
simply expects haplotype data to be coded 0/1.  Unstandardized iHS scores are 
thus reported as ln(iHH1/iHH0) based on the coding you have provided."""

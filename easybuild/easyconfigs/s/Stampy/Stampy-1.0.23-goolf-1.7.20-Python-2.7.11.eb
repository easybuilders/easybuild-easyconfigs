description = """  Stampy is a package for the mapping of short reads from illumina 
 sequencing machines onto a reference genome. It's recommended for most workflows, 
 including those for genomic resequencing, RNA-Seq and Chip-seq. Stampy excels in 
 the mapping of reads containing that contain sequence variation relative to the 
 reference, in particular for those containing insertions or deletions. It can map 
 reads from a highly divergent species to a reference genome for instance. Stampy 
 achieves high sensitivity and speed by using a fast hashing algorithm and a detailed 
 statistical model. """

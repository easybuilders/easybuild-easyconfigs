description = """ SSAHA2 (Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm) is a 
 pairwise sequence alignment program designed for the efficient mapping of sequencing 
 reads onto genomic reference sequences. SSAHA2 reads of most sequencing platforms 
 (ABI-Sanger, Roche 454, Illumina-Solexa) and a range of output formats (SAM, CIGAR, PSL etc.) 
 are supported. A pile-up pipeline for analysis and genotype calling is available as 
 a separate package. """

description = """SCANMS is an open source utility written in Perl that works in 
 conjunction with Richard Hudson’s coalescent simulator MS to do parametric 
 bootstrapping of a sliding window analysis of neutrality test statistics. 
 Currently supported statistics are Tajima’s D and Fu and Li’s D* and F*. 
 Its output of a joint distribution of window minima and maxima may then be 
 used to correct for multiple comparisons in such analyses."""

description = """Smoldyn is a computer program for cell-scale biochemical simulations. It simulates each molecule of 
interest individually to capture natural stochasticity and to yield nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It treats 
other molecules implicitly, enabling it to simulate hundreds of thousands of molecules over several minutes of real 
time. Simulated molecules diffuse, react, are confined by surfaces, and bind to membranes much as they would in a real 
biological system.

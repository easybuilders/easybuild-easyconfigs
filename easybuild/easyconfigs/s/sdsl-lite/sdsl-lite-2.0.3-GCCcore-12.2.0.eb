description = """The Succinct Data Structure Library (SDSL) is a powerful and flexible C++11 library implementing
 succinct data structures. In total, the library contains the highlights of 40 research publications. Succinct
 data structures can represent an object (such as a bitvector or a tree) in space close to the information-theoretic
 lower bound of the object while supporting operations of the original object efficiently. The theoretical time
 complexity of an operation performed on the classical data structure and the equivalent succinct data structure
 are (most of the time) identical."""

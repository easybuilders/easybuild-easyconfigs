description = """
Single-cell RNA Quantity Informed Deconvolution.
SQUID is an R package for conducting (tumor) deconvolution analyses.
SQUID executes a combination of RNA-Seq transformation and dampened weighted least-squares deconvolution to predict
the composition of cell mixtures and tissue samples based on the concurrent RNA-Seq and scnRNA-Seq profiles.
SQUID harnesses the power of concurrent RNA-Seq and scnRNA-Seq profiling,
outperforming other methods in predicting the composition of cell mixtures and tissue samples.

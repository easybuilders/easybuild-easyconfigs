description = """SIONlib is a scalable I/O library for parallel access to task-local files.
 The library not only supports writing and reading binary data to or from several thousands of
 processors into a single or a small number of physical files, but also provides global open
 and close functions to access SIONlib files in parallel. This package provides a stripped-down
 installation of SIONlib for use with performance tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols
 to avoid conflicts when an application using SIONlib itself is linked against a tool requiring
 a different SIONlib version."""

 The library not only supports writing and reading binary data to or from several thousands of
 processors into a single or a small number of physical files, but also provides global open
 and close functions to access SIONlib files in parallel. SIONlib provides different interfaces:
 parallel access using MPI, OpenMP, or their combination, and sequential access for post-processing
 utilities."""

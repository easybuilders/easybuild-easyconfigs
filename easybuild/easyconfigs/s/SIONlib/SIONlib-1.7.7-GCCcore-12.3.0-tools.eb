description = """
 SIONlib is a scalable I/O library for parallel access to task-local files.
 The library not only supports writing and reading binary data to or from
 several thousands of processors into a single or a small number of physical
 files, but also provides global open and close functions to access SIONlib
 files in parallel. This package provides a stripped-down installation of
 SIONlib for use with performance tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols
 to avoid conflicts when an application using SIONlib itself is linked against
 a tool requiring a different SIONlib version.

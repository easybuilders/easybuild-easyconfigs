description = """
 High throughput sequencing technologies generate large amounts of short reads.
 Mapping these to a reference sequence consumes large amounts of processing
 time and memory, and read mapping errors can lead to noisy or incorrect
 alignments. SNP-o-matic is a fast, memory-efficient, and stringent read
 mapping tool offering a variety of analytical output functions, with an
 emphasis on genotyping.

description = """Stereo-seq Analysis Workflow (SAW) software suite is a set of
 pipelines bundled to map sequenced reads to their spatial location on the tissue
 section, quantify spatial feature expression, and visually present spatial expression
 distribution. SAW processes the data from the Stereo-seq sequencing platform, combined
 with microscope images, to generate spatial feature expression matrices. Analysts can
 use the output files as a starting point to perform downstream analysis.
